## About the project

This project is a simple recreation of the layout of a simlpe admin dashboard. It was made with the main intent of practicing the usage of CSS (mainly the usage of the grid layout) to create an application with a responsive content display.

### Responsiveness

The interesting thing about the 'responsiveness' on this page is that i didn't use the tag `@media` to create it. It basically works only through the use of the grid layout usage. But the downside is: as i only use the grid layout on the main content of the page, the other contents won't adapt to a smaller screen. So there is still a lot to improve on that aspect.
