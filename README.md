## Features

### Responsiveness

![Responsiveness GIF example](https://github.com/Nicog03/admin-dashboard/blob/main/readme-content/resp.gif)

The interesting thing about the 'responsiveness' on this page is that i didn't use the tag `@media` to create it. It basically works only through the use of the grid layout usage. But the downside is: as i only use the grid layout on the main content of the page, the other contents won't adapt to a smaller screen. So there is still a lot to improve on that aspect.

### Possible Improvements

As mentioned before, this is a pretty simple project, so it's a little bit hard to think on some improvements. BUT i do have some things in mind, mostly regarding browser compatibility, or even improvements to the responsiveness.

#### Responsiveness

Let's be honest: the responsiveness is here, but it's not exactly THAT good, so theres a lot to improve in that aspect. I believe that the main objective here is to make this page cross-device responsive, so that we can access it from ant device, being it a mobile phone or a desktop.
